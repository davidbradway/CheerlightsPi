## Desription
Last year, I was inspired by [Dave Koerner's NÃ˜HIO LOGBOOK](http://n0hio.wordpress.com/2013/12/06/cheerlights-project).

Then I put together a Cheerlights display using a Ubuntu computer, Adafruit FLORA Arduino, and 8 FLORA NeoPixels:

This year, thanks to Tony DiCola's Python wrapper for the the excellent rpi_ws281x library created by Jeremy Garff, I could redo the project and cut out the Arduino!
