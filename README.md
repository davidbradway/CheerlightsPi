CheerlightsPi
=============

Quick and dirty method of changing the color of some RGB LEDs connected to a RaspberryPi based on the cheerlights feed.

Future Updates:
---------------

Fine tune output colors
Control multiple RGB LEDs using Ti TLC5940
Create transition effects
Log from python rather than print current color
